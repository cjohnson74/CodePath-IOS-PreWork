**Tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS that can split the bill between up to 5 people.

Submitted by: **Carson D. Johnson**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by sliding to different values on the sliding control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] When spliting the total value the total per person, tip per person, and bill per person is divided and shown.
- [X] Added dark mode feature in settings view

## Notes

Getting help from forums is a little more difficult when programming with Swift than, for example, JavaScript or C# because the community is a bit smaller. Although, it takes a little longer to find answers I was able to figure out my problems when I combined the swift documentation along with forum posts.
